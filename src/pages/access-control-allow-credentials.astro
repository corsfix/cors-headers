    "The `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header indicates whether the browser should include credentials (such as cookies, authorization headers, or TLS client certificates) when making cross-origin requests. When a frontend makes a request with credentials (e.g. cookies), the browser checks for this header. The browser first sends an OPTIONS request, if this preflight response includes `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`, the browser then proceeds to send the actual request. The server's response to this actual request must *also* include `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` for the browser to expose the response to the frontend JavaScript code.",
