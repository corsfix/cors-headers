  description: `The Access-Control-Max-Age header specifies how long (in seconds) the browser can cache the results of a CORS preflight request.<br/><br/>
Caching preflight responses improves performance by allowing subsequent identical cross-origin requests to skip the preflight check for the specified duration, reducing latency and server load.`,
  syntax: {
    code: `Access-Control-Max-Age: <seconds>`,
    description:
      "The Access-Control-Max-Age header accepts a numeric value representing the number of seconds (e.g., `86400` for one day) that the preflight response can be cached by the browser. This reduces the number of preflight requests for subsequent identical CORS requests during the specified time period.",
